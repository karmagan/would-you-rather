# Would You Rather project for Udacity Nanodegree

This Project is my submission for Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

The App is a 'Would You Rather' game. You can login as one of the users using the login page. Click on one of the polls and submit your answer. You can create your own poll using the 'New Poll' page. See how you perform compared to other users in the 'Leaderboard' page.

## Installation

To use the app:

* install with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`

## Acknowledgements
